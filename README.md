# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Recognition-App

I'm building the base of my project with Fun AI Lab's tutorial on building a real time ASL recognition App.
My goal is to learn how deep learning works, and try to upgrade this code so the user may be able to chose different types of sign language to recognise and translate, being able to track sentences and give live subtitles, and many more things !!!
